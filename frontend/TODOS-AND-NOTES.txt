-number of wins should be unique for each key
-maybe have a mistake counter. if more than 3 game resets.
-(far in future) log in, user can have number of wins for each key which is saved in a db
-note to number but for various modes also
-figure out styling
-fix error messages in NoteExercise and ModeExercise



flashing wrong made with chatgpt, should try to understand this better. maybe rewrite it from memory


For all games:
   a timer maybe? 
   -> user presses exercise in header
   -> render start button (maybe info on how to play game also)
   -> user presses start, render game
   -> start timer
   -> when user presses finish button or exits game, stats are saved. (time, score, mistakes) 


chord game
-> user chooses key (say C)
-> random chord (either Cmaj7, Cm7, C7, Cm7b5 ) is rendered 
-> prompt: What chord is this? C E G B
-> user picks which they think is correct



rendering random chord:
-> needs the key chosen : chosenKeyAndScale : Maybe TheoryApi.MajorScaleAndKey
-> Randomize a chord from that key and assign it to randomizedChord : randomizedChord : Maybe String
-> 

chord builder logic
   major-scale.notes contains all the notes of the chosen key's major scale. i can build a 
   major chord for each key by specifying the notes at index 0, 2, 4, 6 CDEFGAB = C E G B
   new list of notes ["C", "E", "G", "B"] chord formulas 



   postgreSql, prisma for db graphql

   maybe shoelace css 



User clicks exercises -> Exercises page -> User chooses an exercise (chord guesser)-> Chord Guesser Exercise Startpage
-> at top of page user can choose 
EASY(Chords to guess from keys: C, G, F)
MEDIUM(Chords to guess from keys: C, G, F, D, A, B♭, E♭,), 
HARD(C, G, F, D, A, B♭, E♭, E, B, A♭, D♭,)
EXTREME(C, G, F, D, A, B♭, E♭, E, B, A♭, D♭, F#, C#, G#, D#, A#)


i think i need to add a level column to the user table. 
i also think i need to add comleted_exercises column to user table

new note: skip user-lvel. for each game there is easy hard medium, user chooses easy hard or medium and completes the exercises inside the difficulty instead

users table column: completed_exercises. Needs to be marked for difficulty also. Ex chordguesser game on easy and complete Major and Minor

maybe a new table? completed_exercises

completed_exercises:
id: PK
userId: INT FK
exerciseId: INT FK
difficulty: INT (0 = easy 1 = medium etc)


user chooses chord guesser game 
-> user now chooses which "subexercise" ie which chord-types they want to practice on
-> user is correct say 10 times, each time correct a bar fills up to show progress for that exercise. when user fills bar up subexercise is completed. 
-> exercise will be marked as complete (maybe add completed levels column to user table?), user can still play subexercise to practice

   





user level:
starts off on level 1 ->
level 1-2 needs 10 exp
-> exp needed doubles for each level (2-3 is 20, 3-4 is 40 etc)
