-add on delete cascade on users database schema where needed

-hash refresh token

-maybe rename middleware validations to ex validateExercisePayload etc

-make sure i return the res on the endpoints in controllers

-deleted users saved in deleted_users table. should be able to recover from there

-could make more efficient authorization checkers with middleware, future project if i have time

-rate limiter if i have time

maybe remove description from exercises table?

api:

“root descriptor” (a list of available endpoints) when navigating to url without specific endpoints

frontend:



User clicks exercises -> Exercises page -> User chooses an exercise (chord guesser)-> Chord Guesser Exercise Startpage
-> at top of page user can choose 
EASY(Chords to guess from keys: C, G, F)
MEDIUM(Chords to guess from keys: C, G, F, D, A, B♭, E♭,), 
HARD(C, G, F, D, A, B♭, E♭, E, B, A♭, D♭,)
EXTREME(C, G, F, D, A, B♭, E♭, E, B, A♭, D♭, F#, C#, G#, D#, A#)


i also think i need to add comleted_exercises column to user table

new note: skip user-lvel. for each game there is easy hard medium, user chooses easy hard or medium and completes the exercises inside the difficulty instead

users table column: completed_exercises. Needs to be marked for difficulty also. Ex chordguesser game on easy and complete Major and Minor

maybe a new table? completed_exercises

completed_exercises:
id: PK
userId: INT FK
exerciseId: INT FK
subexerciseId: INT FK

subexercises:
id: PK
exerciseId: INT FK
difficulty: INT (0 = easy 1 = medium etc)


user chooses chord guesser game 
-> user now chooses which "subexercise" ie which chord-types they want to practice on
-> user is correct say 10 times, each time correct a bar fills up to show progress for that exercise. when user fills bar up subexercise is completed. 
-> exercise will be marked as complete (maybe add completed levels column to user table?), user can still play subexercise to practice

   


need to create subexercises table also. each s


user level:
starts off on level 1 ->
level 1-2 needs 10 exp
-> exp needed doubles for each level (2-3 is 20, 3-4 is 40 etc)
